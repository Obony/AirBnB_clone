# AirBnB Clone

## Description
The first phase of a four phase project, where we create a basic clone of the AirBnB web app. A basic console was created using the Cmd Python module, to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy to the existing classes and subclasses.

## Environment
The console was developed in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3).
